* Before proceeding you need to ensure that greasemonkey is turned off by left clicking on its icon in the bottom right corner of your browser window (it should be greyed out)
* Click on the glitter.user.js link inside the repository browser
* Select the raw viewing option in the top right corner of the code window
* Turn on greasemonkey by left clicking on its icon and it should autodetect the presence of the script
* Allow greasemonkey to install the script and then proceed to log in to your twitter account as per normal.

h2. Dependencies
